# Manual Setup Instructions

## GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

Due to GitHub App permissions restrictions, the GitHub Actions workflow file needs to be added manually. Here's how to complete the setup:

### Step 1: Add the GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Navigate to your repository on GitHub**
2. **Create the workflow directory** (if it doesn't exist):
   - Go to `.github/workflows/`
   - If this directory doesn't exist, create it

3. **Create the workflow file**:
   - Create a new file called `ci.yml` in `.github/workflows/`
   - Copy the contents from `ci.yml.backup` (in the root of the repository)

### Step 2: Configure PyPI Publishing (Required for Releases)

1. **Get a PyPI API token**:
   - Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/
   - Create an API token with scope for this project

2. **Add the token to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your repository settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
   - Add a new repository secret named `PYPI_TOKEN`
   - Paste your PyPI API token as the value

### Step 3: Test the Pipeline

1. **Create a test tag** to trigger the release workflow:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

2. **Check the Actions tab** in your GitHub repository to see the workflow run

## Complete GitHub Actions Workflow Content

Here's the complete `ci.yml` file that should be placed in `.github/workflows/`:

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI

If you have the GitHub CLI installed, you can also create the workflow file directly:

```bash
# Create the workflow directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy the workflow file
cp ci.yml.backup .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Add and commit
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "feat: add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow"
git push origin main
```

## Verification

After adding the workflow file, you should see:

1. **Actions tab** in your GitHub repository shows the workflow
2. **Workflow runs** on pushes to main and pull requests
3. **Releases** are created automatically when you push tags starting with `v`

## Quick Start After Setup

1. **For development:**
   ```bash
   make setup
   make test
   make build
   ```

2. **For releases:**
   ```bash
   make release VERSION=1.2.3
   ```

This will handle everything automatically through the GitHub Actions pipeline!
